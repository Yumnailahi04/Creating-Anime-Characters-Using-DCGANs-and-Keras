# Creating anime characters using DCGANs and Keras 🤗🤗🤗
#### Anime characters are fictional characters that originate from anime, a style of animation that originated in Japan and has become popular worldwide. These characters are often depicted with exaggerated features, colorful hair and eyes, and distinctive clothing styles.
#### GANs is a class of machine learning frameworks, which could generate new and realistic photograph that is authentic to human observers.
#### Keras is a high-level library or application programming interface (API) written in Python that runs on top of TensorFlow. Keras is designed to facilitate the construction and creation of deep learning models more quickly.
#### This project aims to instruct and guide us through the implementation of creating anime characters using DCGANs and Keras.
